This page is a part of the [public sector](/#public-sectors) series, offered by the [Public Works](/) book club.
It serves to organize information, across different textual works, about the early part of [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity).
The time periods covered by this page begins with the resurgence of Greek writing and the first [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games) (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ ἀγῶνες)
in __776 BCE__, around the time of [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) (Ὅμηρος)
, and ends with the death of [King Philip II of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon) (Φίλιππος),
in __336 BCE__ , around the time of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (Ἀριστοτέλης).

This corresponds roughly to the
[Archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greece)
and
[Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece)
Periods of ancient Greece _(although the rise of [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) (Ἀλέξανδρος) falls within the Classical Period, we will be cover it in a follow up [public sector](/#public-sectors))_.

## Historical Context

* Humans have been in Greece for 200,000 years (earliest Homo sapiens remains found outside of Africa)
* First evidence of farming in Europe was found in Greece, going back to c. 7,000 BCE


### Neolithic Greece and Before

Humans have been in Greece for over 200,000 years, where the earliest *Homo sapiens* remains outside of Africa have been discovered. The earliest evidence of the domestication of cats was [discovered in Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_cat#Archaeological_evidence) around 9500 BCE. It is upon the emergence of farming around __7000 BCE__ that we mark the beginning of [Neolithic Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Greece) __(c. 7000 – c. 3200 BCE)__. This is the earliest evidence of farming in Europe, most likely due to Greece's close proximity to Asia.

### Bronze Age (c. 3200 - 776 BCE)

The [Bronze Age](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) in Greece begins with the [Minoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization) around 3200 BCE, on the island of Crete. These people are considered the "first link" in the European chain, and are known for their large palaces built, the largest is that of [Knossos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos). The humongous palaces of the era are strong indicates of the oldest advanced civilization in Europe.

Later came the [Mycenaeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece).

This is all work in progress. To be continued...

This page is a part of the [public sector](/#public-sectors) series, offered by the [Public Works](/) book club.
It serves to organize information, across different textual works, about the early part of [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity).
The time periods covered by this page begins with the resurgence of Greek writing and the first [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games) (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ ἀγῶνες)
in __776 BCE__, around the time of [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) (Ὅμηρος)
, and ends with the death of [King Philip II of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon) (Φίλιππος),
in __336 BCE__ , around the time of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (Ἀριστοτέλης).

This corresponds roughly to the
[Archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greece)
and
[Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece)
Periods of ancient Greece _(although the rise of [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) (Ἀλέξανδρος) falls within the Classical Period, we will be cover it in a follow up [public sector](/#public-sectors))_.

## Historical Context

### Neolithic Greece and Earlier

Humans have been in Greece for over 200,000 years, where the earliest *Homo sapiens* remains outside of Africa have been discovered. The earliest evidence of the domestication of cats was [discovered in Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_cat#Archaeological_evidence) around 9500 BCE. It is upon the emergence of farming around __7000 BCE__ that we mark the beginning of [Neolithic Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Greece) __(c. 7000 – c. 3200 BCE)__. This is the earliest evidence of farming in Europe, most likely due to Greece's close proximity to Asia.

### Bronze Age (c. 3200 – c. 1200 BCE)

#### Minoan Civilization (c. 3200 – c. 1100 BCE)

The [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) in Greece begins with the [Minoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization) c. 3200 BCE, on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, called thus by archeologists after the mythical [King Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos). These people are considered the "first link" in the European chain, and are considered the oldest advanced civilization in Europe, due to the large palaces they built and left behind, the largest of which is [Knossos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos). There is evidence between c. 1800 BCE and c. 1450 BCE of a potential Minoan writing system called [Linear A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A). Their civilization experienced a a slow decline starting c. 1550 BCE, for reasons that are still unclear, although the timeline corresponds roughly with the rise of the [Mycenaean Civilization](#minoan-civilization-c-3200-c-1100-bce), as well as the [volcanic eruption of Thera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption), which is modern day Santorini.

It was this volcanic eruption that buried the nearby Minoan settlement of [Akrotiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)), leaving the ruins remarkable well-preserved, similar to the famous [Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii) well over a thousands years after it.

#### Mycenaean Civilization (c. 1750 – c. 1050 BC)

Another, important civilization belongs to the [Mycenaeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece), who were part of the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece, roughly coinciding with the mythical and quasi-historical [Trojan War](#trojan-war). Unlike the [Minoans](#minoan-civilization-c-3200-c-1100-bce), the Mycenaeans were mainlanders,
